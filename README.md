This is a repository with various kinds of scripts/guides I wrote, or found online, on my workstation running on Clear Linux.

Currently I'm working on these:
- ☑ Scripts to automate installation and uninstallation of NVIDIA Proprietary Driver for Linux.
- ☐ Guides to install CUDA Toolkits on Clear Linux.
